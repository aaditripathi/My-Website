                <h2 class="text-xl">HTML</h2>
                <P class="text-md">HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It provides a structure for organizing and presenting content on the Internet.

                    At its core, HTML consists of a series of tags that define the elements and structure of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are typically written in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content to be displayed on the web page is placed between the opening and closing tags.
                    
                    HTML tags are used to define various types of elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, forms, and more. Each element has a specific purpose and provides a way to structure and format the content within a web page.</P>

                <h2 class="text-xl">CSS</h2>
                <P class="text-md">CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental web development language used to describe the presentation and style of a document written in HTML or XML. It provides web designers and developers with the ability to control the layout, formatting, and appearance of web pages, allowing for a visually appealing and consistent user experience across different devices and browsers.

                    The primary purpose of CSS is to separate the content of a web page from its presentation. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, developers can define how different elements should be displayed, such as specifying colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and positioning. This separation of concerns between content and presentation allows for more flexible and efficient web development, as changes to the design can be made in the CSS file without modifying the HTML structure.</P>

                    SQL was first developed in the 1970s and has since become the de facto language for working with relational databases. It is widely supported by various database systems, including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite, among others.</P>
